## Chapter 1 Notes

- Add runtime dependencies `rack`, `rack-test`, `minitest`.
- Rack is a gem to interface a web framework to a Ruby application server such as Thin, Puma, Passenger, WEBrick or Unicorn.
- `gemspec` is evaluated by apps and libraries that depend on this gem, so itâ€™s necessary if other apps use this library.
- By explicitly prepending to the load path, ensure that the local version of the gem code is used first
  - so it doesn't matter what gem version has been installed on this machine

### Initialize
